    <h1>The rise of E-cigarette usage in the United States</h1>
    <h2>A look into the increase in the percent of E-cigarette smokers and total sales</h2>
    <h3>By Katelynn Winebrenner</h3>
    <p>E-Cigarattes are on the rise. Since 2019, data from the National Center for Health Statistics has shown a gradual increase in the percent of E-cigarette smokers in the United States. By contrast, there has been a gradual decrease in traditional cigarette usage. However, cigarettes are still more common. The large increase in E-cigarette sales from 2015 until 2021, shown in a Federal Trade Commission report from 2021, also cooberates e-cigarette prominence in people's lives. </p>
