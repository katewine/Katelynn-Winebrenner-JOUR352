                        An informant who has spent most of the last three
                        decades in and out of lockups has helped send two men to
                        prison for life in separate cases in Georgia — and is
                        now a target of lawyers who say he made false claims in
                        an attempt to spare himself time behind bars.

                        Sterling Flint, 54, was a key witness against Sonny
                        Bharadia, who was found guilty of a 2001 sexual assault
                        near Savannah. Flint testified against Bharadia as part
                        of a deal with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to
                        a lesser charge related to the crime. Flint’s DNA has
                        since been found on a glove used by the attacker.
