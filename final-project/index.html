                        An informant who has spent most of the last three
                        decades in and out of lockups has helped send two men to
                        prison for life in separate cases in Georgia — and is
                        now a target of lawyers who say he made false claims in
                        an attempt to spare himself time behind bars.

                    <p>
                        Sterling Flint, 54, was a key witness against Sonny
                        Bharadia, who was found guilty of a 2001 sexual assault
                        near Savannah. Flint testified against Bharadia as part
                        of a deal with prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to
                        a lesser charge related to the crime. Flint’s DNA has
                        since been found on a glove used by the attacker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2009, six years after Bharadia’s conviction, Flint
                        was taken into custody outside Atlanta and questioned
                        about a load of suspected stolen goods in a car he was
                        driving. Unsolicited, Flint provided an incriminating
                        statement against Erik Heard, who had just been arrested
                        in the fatal shooting of a young mother. Flint offered
                        to obtain more information if he was released on bond.
                        Flint later disavowed that statement at Heard’s trial,
                        but a jury found Heard guilty.

                        Lawyers at the Georgia Innocence Project are trying to
                        get Bharadia and Heard freed, saying both cases were
                        deeply flawed. In courtrooms a hundred miles apart, they
                        have made Flint part of their arguments. A judge
                        recently granted Bharadia a new trial; a decision on
                        Heard’s request for a new trial remains pending.

                        She added: “The harm that Sterling Flint has done to
                        these two men is exactly why law enforcement should be
                        wary of relying on a witness who has every incentive to
                        fabricate testimony in order to help their own case.”

                        NBC News could not reach Flint and tried to contact him
                        through relatives, including an aunt who said she would
                        forward the request but did not respond to follow-up
                        messages.

                        In his 2009 interview with officers, Flint defended
                        himself, saying he was “no bad person,” according to a
                        transcript of the interview.

                        The use of informants in criminal cases, particularly
                        those with an incentive to provide incriminating
                        information about a suspect, is a contentious issue in
                        the United States, with defense attorneys and civil
                        rights advocates arguing that informants can be
                        unreliable and cause innocent people to end up in
                        prison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Researchers have found that juries tend to believe
                        informants — and are often unable to tell when they are
                        mistaken or lying. A 2011 study of 250 wrongful
                        convictions found that 52, or 21%, involved informants.
                        Some states, including Connecticut, Florida, Illinois
                        and Texas, have taken measures to regulate the use of
                        informants.

                    <p>
                        If authorities use an informant, they need to make sure
                        they can corroborate what the person is telling them,
                        especially in cases where the informant is seeking to
                        get something in return, said Summer Stephan, the
                        district attorney for San Diego County and the incoming
                        president of the National District Attorneys

                        or having someone wrongfully convicted," Stephan said.

                    <p>
                        Flint’s statements weren’t the only pieces of evidence
                        used to convict Bharadia and Heard; both cases also
                        involved witnesses pointing out their faces — and the
                        faces of alleged accomplices — on photo arrays. Both
                        men’s lawyers have said the photo arrays were suggestive
                        and flawed. For years, researchers have demonstrated the
                        fallibility of eyewitness identification, particularly
                        among traumatized victims.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are also questions about crime-scene evidence. In
                        Bharadia’s case, it took years to get the DNA testing
                        that pointed to Flint. In Heard’s case, it took years
                        for his lawyers to find that fingerprints lifted from
                        the victim’s front door did not match his.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In both cases, the men’s lawyers say their prior lawyers
                        failed to adequately raise issues around that evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Georgia’s Office of the Attorney General has defended
                        the convictions and argued against either man receiving
                        a new trial. The office declined to comment.

                    <p>
                        The district attorney’s office in Chatham County, which
                        prosecuted Bharadia, did not respond to requests for
                        comment. The prosecutor who tried Bharadia’s case did
                        not respond to requests for comment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tasha Mosley, the district attorney in Clayton County,
                        where Heard was prosecuted in 2012, said she could not
                        comment because no one who worked on the case remained
                        employed there. The lead prosecutor on the case, now in
                        private practice, did not return a request for comment.

                    <p>
                        Flint has spent a significant portion of his life behind
                        bars, including seven prison stints since the 1990s,
                        mostly for burglaries and theft, according to Georgia
                        Department of Corrections records. In 2009, as he was
                        telling officers that he had information about Heard, he
                        also said he’d been diagnosed with skin cancer, did odd
                        jobs, lived “one step from homeless,” was mourning the
                        death of a brother, and was worried about the effect of
                        his arrest on his family, including a daughter,
                        according to a transcript provided by the Georgia
                        Innocence Project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eight years later, when Flint was facing a drug charge
                        in Fulton County, his lawyer told a judge that he’d
                        known Flint for years and described him as a family man,
                        a writer and the owner of a small security company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “He’s imperfect, as we all are,” the lawyer, Carey
                        Johnson, said, according to a transcript of the hearing.
                        “But that being said, I can say he is, I consider him, a
                        good guy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around noon on Nov. 18, 2001, a woman returned from
                        church to her apartment in Thunderbolt, Georgia, and
                        found a man burglarizing it, according to court records.
                        The man, wearing batting gloves, pushed her into a
                        bedroom, took off her clothes, tied her to a bed,
                        threatened to kill her, sexually assaulted her and fled.
                        When she freed herself, she noticed several things had
                        been taken from her apartment. She spoke to the police
                        the next day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later that week, Bharadia called police to report that
                        Flint, an acquaintance, had stolen his car, records say.
                        As police investigated, they visited a friend of Flint’s
                        in Savannah. The friend showed police items she said
                        Flint had left in her house, including things reported
                        stolen during the sex assault — as well as a pair of
                        batting gloves that matched the victim’s description of
                        what the attacker had worn, court records say.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A detective in Thunderbolt found out about this
                        discovery and put Flint’s picture in a photo array for
                        the assault victim, according to court records. She
                        picked out photos of Flint and another man as possibly
                        being the assailant. Flint was arrested, and he told
                        police he had received the stolen items from Bharadia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the time, Bharadia was a sheetmetal worker living
                        with his parents and was on parole for operating a
                        stolen-car chop-shop, his lawyers said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The detective put Bharadia’s picture in a photo array
                        that did not include Flint, records show. This time, the
                        victim identified Bharadia as her attacker. That photo
                        array disappeared from the case file prior to Bharadia’s
                        trial and was never recovered, court records say. But
                        the detective used the identification to obtain a
                        warrant for Bharadia’s arrest for the assault.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flint was charged with burglary and theft by receiving
                        stolen property. He pleaded guilty to the second charge
                        in exchange for the first charge being dismissed. And he
                        agreed to testify against Bharadia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Bharadia’s trial, Flint testified that Bharadia gave
                        him the items found in his friend’s house. The victim
                        identified the blue and white batting gloves as the ones
                        worn by her attacker, and she told the jury she was sure
                        that Bharadia was the person who assaulted her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The jury convicted Bharadia of burglary, aggravated
                        sodomy and aggravated sexual battery. He was sentenced
                        to life in prison without parole.

                    <p>
                        Years later, Bharadia got a court order for DNA testing
                        on the batting gloves. In 2012, the results came back: a
                        single male DNA profile taken from the gloves matched
                        Flint’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For another decade, both sides argued over whether the
                        DNA result was grounds for Bharadia's conviction to be
                        tossed. His fortunes turned last week, when a Gwinnett
                        County Superior Court judge ruled that Bharadia did
                        deserve a new trial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The judge, Laura Tate, said she agreed with Bharadia’s
                        argument that his past lawyers had failed to properly
                        handle issues related to DNA testing, failed to raise
                        questions about the missing photo arrays and the
                        reliability of the eyewitness identification — and
                        failed to challenge the truth of Flint’s statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s unclear how soon a new trial can take place. The
                        state has 30 days to appeal the order.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In August 2009, after Flint had served time for the
                        receiving stolen property charge, he was picked up in
                        Cobb County in a car filled with goods suspected of
                        being stolen. As detectives questioned him, Flint
                        steered the conversation to another topic: an arrest in
                        a murder case that had recently been on TV. A young
                        mother, Sherveecka Pitts, 22, had been shot in a home
                        invasion; her 17-year-old sister had witnessed it, and
                        picked Erik Heard out of a photo array.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flint told the detectives he had overheard the suspect
                        on the street alluding to committing the killing,
                        according to a transcript of the interview provided by
                        the Georgia Innocence Project. Flint identified the man
                        as Charles Black, which was an alias of Heard’s,
                        authorities said at the trial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Cobb County detectives brought in two detectives
                        from Clayton County who were investigating the murder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flint offered to find out more if he was able to post
                        bond and be released, according to the transcript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “If I can get outta here and this is — I swear to you
                        guys, I could take you, you know, and you could hear
                        things,” Flint said. “Whatever I need to do. Wire up.
                        I’ll wire up for you and get all the information you
                        need.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Neither Flint nor the detectives agreed to any
                        arrangement in the conversations covered in the
                        transcription. But toward the end, Flint asked, “Do I
                        get a bond?” and a Cobb detective responded, “Yeah, you
                        get a bond.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Flint’s statements remained crucial to the case against
                        Heard — who had two young children and sold marijuana,
                        according to his lawyers — when he went to trial three
                        years later. Prosecutors submitted a video of Flint’s
                        2009 meeting with detectives into evidence. But when
                        Flint was called to testify about it, he claimed that he
                        did not remember any of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “I actually know nothing about this, nothing at all,”
                        Flint said from the witness stand. “I’m ambivalent, I
                        don’t know him, I don’t actually care what happens to
                        him, but I’m not going to sit here and lie. I mean, I
                        really don’t, I don’t care what happens to him. I don’t
                        know him.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Prosecutors appeared caught off guard by Flint’s
                        reversal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “So even here in this last two minutes you’ve changed
                        your story?” Assistant District Attorney Jason Green
                        said.
                    </p>
                    <p>“That’s correct,” Flint replied.</p>
                    <p>
                        The jury saw portions of the video several times. The
                        victim’s sister also testified that she was “100%
                        confident” Heard was the killer. The jury convicted him,
                        and Heard was sentenced to life in prison.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a petition for a new trial, the Georgia Innocence
                        Project claims that investigators and prosecutors made
                        several mistakes — including a reliance on a flawed
                        sketch drawn from the recollection of the victim’s
                        sister and the use of a “suggestive” photo array in
                        which Heard’s face stood out among the others. Heard’s
                        lawyers also accused prosecutors of withholding evidence
                        that his fingerprints did not match those recovered from
                        the victim’s front door.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, Heard’s lawyers focused on Flint’s apparent bid
                        to exchange information for freedom and his recantation
                        on the witness stand. They described Flint in a court
                        filing as “a jailhouse informant who provided
                        unsubstantiated information to police in exchange for a
                        promise that he would be released from jail on serious
                        felony charges, and who later fully recanted his false
                        statements implicating Heard.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In court filings, the state Attorney General’s Office
                        pushed back on the Georgia Innocence Project’s
                        arguments, saying that Heard should not be given a new
                        trial. The office denied withholding evidence and also
                        said some of the Georgia Innocence Project’s arguments
                        should have been raised sooner or had previously been
                        raised and dismissed.

                        NBC News was not able to reach members of Sherveecka
                        Pitts’ family, including the sister who witnessed her
                        murder.

                        Back in 2009, as Flint, facing prison, told detectives
                        he had information about the killing, he said he didn’t
                        mean any harm. Whenever he had enough money, he said, he
                        bought kids ice cream.

                        Flint said. “I got a conscience.”
